To build a modern MRI machine, simply follow the below steps:

1. Get a big big magnet 
   - To align the hydrogen atoms (protons) in the studied body
2. Freeze the big big magnet with liquid helium (which is around -300 deg Celsius)
   - To turn the magnet into a superconductor 
   - This produces a magnetic field that is 30,000 times strong than Earth's magnetic field
3. Wrap an RF (Radio Frequency) coil around said big big magnet.
   - This coil will help transmit RF waves, which will reduce the energy levels of the hydrogen atoms in the water molecules of the studied body.
4. Capture the energy drop of the atoms once they are released from their newly reached higher energy state
5. Connect entire thing to a computer and run software to produce an image
